# Jumper

This is the readme file for a game called <i>Jumper</i> The rules of jumper are simple.
First, the computer decides on a random word that the player has to guess.
It will then display a list of underscores "\_" representing the letters of that word.
A parachute made out of lines is then shown. This parachute represents how many guesses the player has left.
The player is asked to guess a letter, and if the letter is in the random word, it is revealed in the list of underscores.
If the player runs out of parachute ropes they lose.
